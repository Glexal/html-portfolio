<h3>Iron Man (2008)</h3>
<h> This movie is absolutely incredible, easily my favorite movie ever. The casting of Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark is one of the best casting decisions of all time.<p>
<h3>Indiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark</h3>
<p>This movie is a melting pot of everything action movie fans love, fight scenes, romance, mystery, car chases. Its a classic over the top action movie, what else could a viewer ask for?</p>
<h3>Star Wars: A New Hope</h3>
<p>Some of my favorite worldbuilding in fiction. I love its unique take on space exploration and how spaceship pilots are similar to car guys who just know their vehicle really well.</p>
